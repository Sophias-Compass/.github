# Sophia's Compass

Sophia's Compass is in the early stages of creating educational resources for natural philosophy and the mathematical arts. Our projects fall into two categories: educational resources and production tools.

Educational resources are used by teachers and students directly. This includes textbooks, assesments, and laboratory investigations. The source code for educational resorces is private, but we hope to make products available in the near future. If you would like to contribute to content by becoming a member of Sophia's Compass, please contact Gavin Polhemus.

Production tools assist in creating the educational resources. Specialized tools might create specific elements for diagrams, assist with the creation of problem sets and answer keys, or organize and format content for publication. These tools are public, and we welcome contributions from the community. We hope these tools will be useful to others who wish to create their own educational resources.

## Educational resources

### Our first content project: _The World_

Our first content project is a physics textbook, _The World_, along with the related resources (assesments, laboratory investigations, etc.) _The World_ has an historical approach with a modern perspective. The course is algebra based and designed for high school.

## Content creation and publication tools

### Our first tool project: `luageo`

Our first tool is a ConTeXt module that draws globes.
